I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in Machine Learning. My research focuses on generative models, interpretability, and representation learning.

At Georgia Tech, I work with Prof. Yingyan (Celine) Lin on accelerating diffusion-based LLM inference, and with Prof. Pan Li on adaptive retrieval selection methods. In January 2026, I will join the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems as a research intern to work on Agent Foundation Models.

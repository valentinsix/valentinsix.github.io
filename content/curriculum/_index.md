## Curriculum Vit√¶

Here is a detailed version of my _Curriculum Vit√¶_ (or what got me to where I am today). The objective is also to clarify how the French educational system works, which can be, I must admit it, quite confusing for anyone outside of France.  

A more concise version can be found [here](/cv.pdf).

## üéì Lyc√©e Pierre de Fermat (2020-2022)

I did my "Classe Pr√©paratoire" at the **[Lyc√©e Pierre de Fermat](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Pierre-de-Fermat)** in Toulouse. This establishment is often ranked as one of the best in France for the preparation of students. I mainly studied Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.

> A **Classe Pr√©paratoire** (preparatory class) prepares students to enter a **Grande √âcole** through competitive national exams.

> ‚Äú**Grandes √âcoles** are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. They primarily admit students based on their national ranking in written and oral exams.‚Äù [Read more on Grandes √âcoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole)

> ‚ÄúWhereas enrollment in public universities in France is open to any school leaver with an adequate baccalaur√©at, enrollment in the **Grandes √âcoles** is restricted to the highest-ranked students in a separate national competitive examination. Preparation for this examination entails one of the highest student workloads in Europe.‚Äù

## üíª T√©l√©com SudParis (2022-2024)

After passing the national entry exam for the "Grandes √âcoles", I joined **[T√©l√©com SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/)**, which is part of the **[Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en)**.

>_For non-French readers unfamiliar with this system:_

>When joining a Grande √âcole, will obtain a "Diplome d'Ing√©nieur", which is equivalent to a **Master of Science (MS)** degree. It is important to not that students usually  <u> don't obtain an intermediate Bachelor's degree </u> ; we only get a Master's degree after 5 years (CPGE + Grande √âcole).

At T√©l√©com SudParis, I followed many different classes on various topics: Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Networks, Economics... During our fist year, most students will take classes in different domains, and will later chose a specific domain they want to major in. For the rest of my cursus at TSP, I was a major in Data Science. 

My favourites classes were Applied Statistics, Machine Learning, Stochastic Processes, Bayesian Estimation in Markovian models, and Computer Vision.

## üêù Georgia Tech (2024-2025)

After my time at  T√©l√©com SudParis, I joined the **[Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/)** as a MS student in Computer Science. I first spent a semester at **[Georgia Tech Euope (GTE)](https://europe.gatech.edu/en)**, which is located in Metz.  

At GTE, I took the following courses: Machine Learning (CS 7641), Intro to Grad Algorithms (CS 6515), ML for Robotics (CS 7644), Research for ML and Robotics (CS8813 R).  

For the Special Topics class, I conducted a research project with other graduate students, under the supervision of **[Prof. C√©dric Pradalier](https://research.gatech.edu/people/cedric-pradalier)**.  

Fall 2025 will be my last semester at Georgia Tech, what a journey it was !

Welcome to my **Atomic Blog**! 

I call it that because each post will be short. Simple and focused. Also I’m not a big fan of long essays, and I’d rather write down what I’m thinking while it’s fresh.

Here, I’ll mostly share short notes about research, productivity, and efficiency; basically things I’m trying to figure out as I go.

The goal is to capture my thoughts and keep everything in one place. And if someone finds something useful along the way, great!

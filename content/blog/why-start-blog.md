I thought about starting a blog a few years ago, but never found a real reason to do it.
I don't have a brand to promote, no audience to grow, and I don't particularly enjoy writing just for the sake of it.

So I decided to approach blogging differently. In a way, this is a space for me.
I won't spend hours polishing every post, and I'll write to clear my thoughts and gather ideas in one place. 
Sure, I could keep everything private, but I might as well share it. Maybe someone will stumble upon it and find something useful.

It'll probably be a mess at first, but hopefully over time I'll be able to cluster ideas together and give it some structure.

I call this an **Atomic Blog** because each post is short and focuses on a single idea. Writing this way makes the process easier, both for the writer and the reader. 
Who knows, maybe I’ll end up writing longer pieces if I get into the flow.

The main purposes of this blog are to:

- **Articulate ideas clearly**: Thinking can be messy. It’s easy to lose track of good ideas or circle back to the same thoughts. I’ve realized that writing things down (especially on paper in my case) helps me develop complex ideas without constantly starting over. Writing forces you to give form to thoughts that are otherwise abstract. I see writing and thinking as two sides of the same process: to write is to think clearly enough that your ideas survive translation into words.
- **Centralize all ideas in one place**: I often have the same ideas on multiple occasions, because I eventually forget them. This blog is a way to plant those thoughts in a small garden: to keep track of what’s growing, and to revisit it now and then.

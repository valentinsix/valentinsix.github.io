It sounds odd, but giving yourself less time often helps you produce more.

Sometimes I spend hours on a task and barely move forward. Other times, I make huge progress in a few minutes. So clearly, more time doesn’t always mean more productivity.

This is what Parkinson’s Law describes:

*Work expands to fill the time you give it.*

Here’s a quick a reminder of why time limits matter and how to use them.



- **Time constraints help you start working**: This is somewhat similar to the Pomodoro method; set a short timer and just start. When you know a task will end soon, it’s easier to begin. A five-hour work session feels heavy, but 15 minutes? The time box gives you a finish line to look forward to. Starting becomes less intimidating.
- **Fill the gaps in your day**: Most days never run perfectly on schedule, and that’s fine. But there are always small empty spots: 30 minutes before leaving, an hour between two classes, a random cancel in the afternoon. Instead of waiting for “the right time” to work, one can try to use those gaps. Not to be constantly productive, but to stay in control of my day and not let it drift away just because you have something later.
- **Time limits boost efficiency**: If something is due Friday and you plan to finish by Friday, it will take you all week. But if you tell yourself it must be done by Tuesday, it will often be finished by Tuesday. Sounds super obvious, but we don't use it! More time rarely means better work, it just gives procrastination more space. A shorter window forces focus and makes us prioritize what actually matters.


From my experience, setting clear time constraints is the single most effective way to get more done per time unit.

Work expands, unless you don’t let it.

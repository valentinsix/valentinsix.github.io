Parkinson's Law: *Work expands to fill the time you give it*.

If you have a week to finish something, it will somehow take a week.
If you give yourself two hours, you’ll probably get it done in two.

It’s funny how that works.
Without time limits, we tend to drift, overthink, or or maybe even delay because *"i've got so much time to submit my homework"*.

Time constraints force focus. When the clock is ticking, we stop caring about perfection and just get to the point.

I think it's often a good idea to work with small time boxes: one hour for this, 30 minutes for that.
Sometimes it’s too short, but that’s fine — I can always extend. The key is to start with limits, not without them.

Efficiency isn’t doing more.
It’s doing just enough within a clear frame of time.
